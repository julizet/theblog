I am a Research Associate at the Technologiestiftung Berlin where I was leading the tree-related projects "Gieß den Kiez" and "Quantified Trees" at CityLAB Berlin.
I am currently on a Sabbatical, traveling around the world – mainl in Asia and Meso- and South America – to get my hands dirty instead of sitting behind the desk.
Thus, I am collecting nature-based solutions from all over the world to probe for their applicability in Europe.
